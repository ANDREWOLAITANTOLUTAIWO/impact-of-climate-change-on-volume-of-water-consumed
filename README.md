 This study utilizes LST instead of AT to study the impact of climate change on volume of water consumed in poor urban households. The aim is to assess the impact of climate change temperature variability on volume of water consumed by poor urban households. Spatial and seasonal variations of LST in the study area as a result of climate change is mapped in relation to the location of urban poor households using geospatial technologies. The mapped pattern is fed into machine learning algorithms for modeling and prediction.
